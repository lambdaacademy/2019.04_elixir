## Repo structure

* master holds the end solution
* each step has its own branch
  * the branches are named with `step/{ORIDINAL}-{EXERCISE-SHORT-DESC}`, e.g. (`step/0-connect-to-rabbit`)
  * the beginning of a branch is tagged with `step-{ORIDINAL}-start`, e.g. (`step-0-start`) to see what a completion of one step takes via a diff
  * HEAD of a branch contains the final state for the step
  * if a "step branch" changes, it is merged to master and possibly the master 
  has to be merged to all the subsequent "step branches"
* README at the master branch holds instructions to the correspondins steps

## The workshop

To complete the workshop an instance of the RabbitMQ server is required. One
can be started with docker using the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)
provided: `docker-compose up`.

This will spawn a [RabbitMQ container](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq) and
create the following ports bindings (host->container): `5672:5672` and `15672:15672`.
They are used for AMQP and RabbitMQ server Managment UI respectively 
(http://localhost:15672).

### Step 0: Connections and Channels

1. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/protocol/connection_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/protocol/connection_test.exs) to see how a connection is established and channels are opened
2. Run the tests: `mix test test/rabbit_hole/protocol/connection_test.exs`

### Step 1: Simple producer and consumer

#### Managing queues

1. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/protocol/queue_declare_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/protocol/queue_declare_test.exs) to see how a queue is declared
2. Run the tests `mix test test/rabbit_hole/protocol/queue_declare_test.exs`

#### Publising and consuming

1. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_consume_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_consume_test.exs) to see how a message can be published to and consumed from a queue
2. Run the tests `mix test test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_consume_test.exs`
3. Comment out the queue deletion operation in the first test in `test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_consume_test.exs`, run it:

   `mix test test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_consume_test.exs:23`
   
and see the message enqueued in the `my_queue` through the the management UI: `http://localhost:15672/#/queues` (user/pass: guest/guest).

#### Simple producer and consumer implementation

1. Checkout at [step-1-start](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/tree/step-1-start) tag: `git checkout step-1-start`.
2. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/producer_consumer_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/producer_consumer_test.exs) and see the expected behaviour of the [`RabbitHole.Producer`](lib/rabbit_hole/producer.ex) and the [`RabbitHole.Consumer`](lib/rabbit_hole/consumer.ex).
3. Implement the producer and consumer modules.
4. Check the solution by looking at the diff between the tag and the  head of the [1-simple-producer-consumer branch](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/tree/step/1-simple-producer-consumer): [step-1-start...step/1-simple-producer-consumer](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/compare/step-1-start...step/1-simple-producer-consumer).

### Step 2: Message routing

#### Managing exchanges

1. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/protocol/exchange_declare_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/protocol/exchange_declare_test.exs) to see how to declare an exchange.
2. Run the tests: `mix test --trace test/rabbit_hole/protocol/exchange_declare_test.exs`.

#### Publishing to and consuming from different topics

1. Checkout at [step-2-start](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/tree/step-2-start) tag: `git checkout step-2-start`.
2. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/task/producer_consumer_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/task/producer_consumer_test.exs) and see the expected behaviour of the [`RabbitHole.Task.Producer`](lib/rabbit_hole/task/producer.ex) and the [`RabbitHole.Task.Consumer`](lib/rabbit_hole/task/consumer.ex).
3. Implement the producer and consumer modules.
4. Check the solution by looking at the diff between the tag and the  head of the [2-message-routing](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/tree/step/2-message-routing): [step-2-start...step/2-message-routing](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/compare/step-1-start...step/2-message-routing).

### Step 3: Data integrity

#### Handling Publisher Confirms

1. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_with_confirm_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_with_confirm_test.exs) to see how to use the Publisher confirms.
2. Run the tests: `mix test --trace test/rabbit_hole/protocol/publish_with_confirm_test.exs`

#### Handling Consumer Acknowledgments

1. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/protocol/consume_with_ack_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/protocol/consume_with_ack_test.exs) to see how to use the Publisher confirms.
2. Run the tests: `mix test --trace test/rabbit_hole/protocol/consume_with_ack_test.exs`

#### Publishng and consuming tasks with Confirms and Acks

1. Checkout at [step-3-start](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/tree/step-3-start) tag: `git checkout step-3-start`.
2. Open [`test/rabbit_hole/task/producer_consumer_with_data_integrity_test.exs`](test/rabbit_hole/task/producer_consumer_with_data_integrity_test.exs) and see the expected behaviour of the [`RabbitHole.Task.Producer`](lib/rabbit_hole/task/producer.ex) and the [`RabbitHole.Task.Consumer`](lib/rabbit_hole/task/consumer.ex) with added Publisher Confirms and Consumer Acks respectively.
3. Extend the producer and consumer modules.
4. Check the solution by looking at the diff between the tag and the  head of the [3-data-integrity](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/tree/step/3-data-integrity): [step-3-start...step/3-data-integrity](https://github.com/lambdaacademy/2019.04_elixir/compare/step-3-start...step/3-data-integrity).
